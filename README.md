This playground uses **ARKit** and **SceneKit** to combine music into reality. You can place ðŸŒˆ balls on the table and when you get close to them, they will play music just like playing the piano ðŸŽ¹. This is an interesting way to create music ðŸŽµ.

 ### Scale ðŸŽ¶
 In music theory, a scale is any set of musical notes ordered by fundamental frequency or pitch. Most scales are octave-repeating, meaning their pattern of notes is the same in every octave. For instance, the increasing C major scale is Câ€“Dâ€“Eâ€“Fâ€“Gâ€“Aâ€“Bâ€“[C], with the bracket indicating that the last note is an octave higher than the first note. The eight buttons in the scene represent the increasing C major scale.
